Start Date:
12/12/2019

Current State:
Not Finished

Reasons for Starting On Project:
This Project is for the sole purpose of demonstrating my abilities in Project Design. 

What I Am trying to demonstrate in this project:
1. Independence from usage of external libraries 
2. Design clean, readable, and well documented code. 
3. Document progress.
4. Skillfully designs algorithms and programming logic.
5. Refrain from using any unlicensed or licensed sources on the internet. 

Project Goals:
1. 2D/3D Soft Game Engine
2. Made with C#
3. Made in Win Forms
4. No external libraries other than the .NET library.
5. No external GPU graphics libraries like Open GL or Direct X
6. No external 2D or 3D Physics libraries
7. To design %100 original C# code.

Goals accomplished in order of completion:
1. Brain-stormed minimal needs for the game engine. (12/12/2019)
2. Designed Naming schemes for Namespaces, Classes, and Structs. (12/12/2019)
3. Made contracts for Vector Structs. (12/12/2019)
4. Made contracts for GameObject Classes. (12/12/2019)
5. Implemented contracts for Vector Structs for Linear Algebra Operations. (12/12/2019)
6. Implemented contract for GameObject Class for Video Game Engine Logic. (12/12/2019)
8. Created GITHUB and started submition process (12/12/2019)
7. Updated README on GITHUB (12/12/2019)
